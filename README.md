# 1Φ Full wave controlled rectifier
## Description
A 2-layer PCB for a full-wave controlled bridge rectifier to control the speed and direction of rotation of DC motors and loads of up to 3.5 A. The positive and negative half-cycles of the 220 V, 60 Hz supply can be independently controlled by varying the firing angle of the SCRs using two potentiometers.
